Libraries and Initialization: The code begins by importing the required libraries, and declaring the variables and pins used in the project.

Setup: The setup function sets up the serial communication for debugging and the LCD for display. It also sets up the WiFi connection by providing the network SSID and password. The ESP8266 then connects to this network and starts the server.

Main Loop: In the main loop, the code does the following:

Measures the air quality through the analog input pin. This reading is converted into a percentage and displayed on the LCD.
Checks for client connections to the server. If a client is connected, it responds with an HTTP 200 OK message along with other HTTP headers to construct a simple HTML webpage.
Based on the measured air quality, the webpage provides a status of the air quality: Normal, Medium, or Danger.
The webpage auto-refreshes every 3 seconds (as set in the HTTP "Refresh" header) to display the latest air quality data.
The process repeats for continuous monitoring of air quality.
This code essentially sets up an IoT device that measures air quality and provides this data through a web interface in real-time, enabling monitoring of air quality from any location with internet access.

Here is a LinkedIn post example based on this project:

"I'm excited to share our latest IoT project – An Air Quality Monitoring System!

This solution leverages the power of IoT to provide real-time air quality data, making it easier for us to be aware of the air we breathe.

The system uses an ESP8266 WiFi module to connect to the internet and an air quality sensor to measure the pollution level. This data is then displayed on an LCD and also sent to a web server.

The most interesting part is, you can monitor the air quality from any location through the internet. The system provides a simple web page that displays the current air quality status in three levels – Normal, Medium, or Danger.
